///
/// The BMP contains the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode standard and

/// The provided ranges capture numerals from scripts such as Latin, Arabic,

/// To ascertain specific numeral systems matched by the ranges, one would
/// need to cross-reference with the Unicode code charts using the hex
/// values provided.
